        <h1>Stuck in<br>the middle.</h1>
        <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience, our design team reimagined the California
            Grizzly and used it to create custom tees, pins and posters.</p>

            <h1><span>001</span><br>The<br>Golden<br>Bear</h1>
            <p>This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome difficult situations and come out
                stronger
                than before. It’s a flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the California poppy.
